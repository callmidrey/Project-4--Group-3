# Project-4--Group-3
Bootcamp Project 4- Project Title: Analyzing Home Credit Default Risk

# Introduction
This Project was conducted b 4 group members in the Data Analytics Bootcamp with the University of Toronto School of Continus Studies. The group members are Lovepreet Singh, Kashif Muhammad, Vinay Vattipally and Audrey Nkrumah.

Introduction to the Home Credit Default Risk dataset.

Objectives and goals of the analysis.
The objective of the project is to :
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Understand the distribution and relationships between variables in the dataset.
        Identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
        Explore correlations between features and the target variable.
        Visualize key insights to gain a better understanding of the data.

2. Feature Importance Analysis:
        Determine which features have the most significant impact on predicting default risk.
        Use techniques like feature importance scores from machine learning models or statistical methods to rank features.

3. Risk Segmentation:
        Identify different risk segments within the dataset based on demographic or financial characteristics.
        Analyze the characteristics of high-risk and low-risk groups.
        Develop strategies to mitigate risk for different segments.

4. Customer Profiling:
        Create profiles of different types of customers based on their credit behavior, demographic information, and financial history.
        Understand the characteristics of customers who are more likely to default on their loans.         

5. Build a good predictive model and Interprate the Model to:
        Understand how the predictive model makes decisions.
        Interpret model coefficients, feature importance scores, or other model outputs to explain predictions.
        Identify factors contributing to high or low default probabilities for individual borrowers.
